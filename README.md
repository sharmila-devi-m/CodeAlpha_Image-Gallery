Overview
GlamGallery â€“ A Stylish and Interactive Image Gallery Web App

Introduction
This project is a modern and interactive image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structural layout of the gallery, CSS is used for styling with special emphasis on animations and a glittery purple background, and JavaScript enables interactivity such as image preview in lightbox mode and navigation. The application is designed to be visually appealing, responsive across devices, and easy to expand with additional features.

Core Features of Image Gallery:
Image Display and Layout:
The gallery displays a collection of images arranged in a responsive grid layout using CSS Flexbox. Each image is styled with smooth hover effects and shadow enhancements, ensuring a modern and elegant visual presentation.
Lightbox Functionality:
Clicking on any image opens it in a centered lightbox view with previous and next navigation buttons. The lightbox overlay allows users to focus on one image at a time, with easy controls to browse the collection and a close button to exit.
Animated Background:
The gallery includes a dynamic, glitter-inspired shiny purple gradient background. This animated background, created using CSS gradients and keyframe animation, adds a touch of glamour and makes the interface vibrant and engaging.

Advanced Features:
Responsive Design:
The layout is fully responsive, making the gallery accessible and functional on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, maintaining visual quality and usability.
Styling and Visual Effects:
The CSS styling includes transitions for image hover scaling, drop shadows for depth, and rounded corners for a polished look. The use of a shimmering purple background not only adds uniqueness but also enhances the user's visual experience.
